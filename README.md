# Python_Benginner_Projects
# Python Beginner Game Collection

This Python project is a collection of three classic games suitable for beginners: Hangman, Guess the Number, and Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each game is a separate Python script that you can run independently.

## Games Included

### 1. Hangman

The Hangman game is a word-guessing game. A player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. The game continues until the word is guessed or too many incorrect guesses are made.

To play Hangman, run `hangman.py`.

### 2. Guess the Number

In the Guess the Number game, the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it. The player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

To play Guess the Number, run `guess_the_number.py`.

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

To play Rock, Paper, Scissors, run `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
